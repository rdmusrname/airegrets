4. **Job Redesign and Redeployment:**  As AI automates  tasks, organizations should focus on redesigning jobs to leverage human capabilities and  creativity. Providing employees with opportunities for upskilling and redeployment can help them transition to new roles that  align with their interests and skills.

- **Improved Collaboration Between Humans and AI:** A supportive community fosters collaboration between humans and AI. Employees can learn from and complement AI systems, while AI can assist humans with tasks  that require creativity, empathy and critical thinking.
